# Backend Module - Enqueue Splitwise

This was started with the assumption that Splitwise limits the number of expenses created on a free account.

However, this validation does not apply when expenses are created via the API.

One of the decisions of all time.

This repository is archived until they fix this oversight.

I've repurposed the frontend to just create the entries in a loop instead of scheduling it.
